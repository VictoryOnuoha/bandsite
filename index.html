                <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>

                <p>
                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
                    California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist 
                    Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer
                    Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned
                    act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular
                    acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
                    confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to sign with
                    Magenta Records.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition 
                    and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately 
                    fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying
                     their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
                      century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are 
                      drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. 
                      Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently 
                      recording their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
